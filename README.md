# Data
## Dataset 1: Alcohol Consumption in Russia

Dimension: 1615 rows*7 columns
Following data pre-processing steps may be performed:
  a.	Check for duplicates
  b.	Check for missing values
  c.	Check for outliers
Treatment of those that are flagged in the pre-processing steps.
Following analysis may be of interest:
  a.	Counts of the number of unique regions
  b.	Group by the “Year” variable to calculate aggregate consumption for each alcohol type
  c.	Study consumption trend(s) over the years. Trend test.
  d.	Get aggregate consumption for specific region(s)
  e.	Testing hypothesis: For example, average consumption of two alcohol type is significantly different (two-tailed) or one is significantly higher than the other (one-tailed)
  f.	Predict consumption for next years in the series (time series prediction and others)


## Dataset 2: Belgium Train Times
Dimension: 72609 rows*18 columns
Following data pre-processing steps may be performed:
  a.	Check for duplicates
  b.	Check for missing values
  c.	Check for outliers
Treatment of those that are flagged in the pre-processing steps.
Following analysis may be of interest:
  a.	Counts of the unique train number
  b.	Statistics describing delay at arrival and at departure. For the entire data and then for unique train number
  c.	Testing hypothesis: For example, 

## Dataset 3: Blood Donation
Dimension: 576 rows*6 columns
Following data pre-processing steps may be performed:
a.	Check for duplicates
b.	Check for missing values
c.	Check for outliers
Treatment of those that are flagged in the pre-processing steps.
Following analysis may be of interest:
a.	Distribution of the number of donations: summary statistics and graphs
b.	Distribution of the total volume donated: summary statistics and graphs
c.	Testing hypothesis: For example, on an average, people who made donations in March have donated more often than those who did not make donations in March, historically


## Dataset 4: College Basketball (NCAA)
Dimension: 2455 rows*24 columns
Following data pre-processing steps may be performed:
a.	Check for duplicates
b.	Check for missing values

Following analysis may be of interest:
a.	Count of NCAA competition participation by each team during the period
b.	Count of NCAA competition representation by each conference during the period
c.	Distribution of the number of teams by conference for each year: summary statistics and graphs


## Dataset 5: Medical Cost
Dimension: 1338 rows*7 columns
Following data pre-processing steps may be performed:
a.	Check for duplicates
b.	Check for missing values
c.	Check for outliers/irregular entries
Treatment of those that are flagged in the pre-processing steps.
Following analysis may be of interest:
a.	Distribution of insurance subscribers’ age and bmi : summary statistics and graphs
b.	Distribution of medical cost billed by the insurance company: summary statistics and graph
c.	Testing hypothesis: For example, on average, medical cost is different for subscribers in South-East and South-West regions.
d.	ANOVA: Is there a difference in the average medical cost charged to insurance subscribers in the four regions?



## Dataset 6: Record Management System (RMS) Crime Incidents for Detroit
Dimension: 508629 rows*25 columns

b.	Distribution of crime incident counts by year, month, week, day, time of day: summary statistics and time series graphs
c.	Distribution of crime incidents by neighborhood, Zip code: summary statistics and graphs (Bar charts, Geo-maps)
d.	Study crime incident trend(s) over the years. Trend test.
e.	Testing hypothesis: For example, on average, more crime incidents are recorded in the first half of a year than in the second half.
