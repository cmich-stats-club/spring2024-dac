# Data
## Dataset 1: [Alcohol Consumption in Russia](https://github.com/cmich-stats-club/spring2024-dac/blob/main/datasets/alcohol-consumption-in-russia.csv)
Dimension: 1615 rows*7 columns  

Check this [source](https://github.com/datacamp/careerhub-data/tree/master/Alcohol%20Consumption%20in%20Russia) for more information about the data.  

The following data pre-processing steps may be performed:  
  *	Check for duplicates
  *	Check for missing values
  *	Check for outliers  

Treat records and attributes that are flagged in the pre-processing steps.   

The following analysis may be of interest:  
  *	Counts of the number of unique regions
  *	Group by the “Year” variable to calculate aggregate consumption for each alcohol type
  *	Study consumption trend(s) over the years. Trend test.
  *	Get aggregate consumption for specific region(s)
  *	Testing hypothesis: For example, average consumption of two alcohol type is significantly different (two-tailed) or one is significantly higher than the other (one-tailed)
  *	Predict consumption for next years in the series (time series prediction and others)

Treatment of those that are flagged in the pre-processing steps.  

The following analysis may be of interest:
  *	Distribution of the number of donations: summary statistics and graphs
  *	Distribution of the total volume donated: summary statistics and graphs
  *	Testing hypothesis: For example, on an average, people who made donations in March have donated more often than those who did not make donations in March, historically

The following data pre-processing steps may be performed:
  *	Check for duplicates
  *	Check for missing values
  *	Check for outliers/irregular entries

Treat records and attributes that are flagged in the pre-processing steps.

The following analysis may be of interest:
  *	Count of NCAA competition participation by each team during the period
  *	Count of NCAA competition representation by each conference during the period
  *	Distribution of the number of teams by conference for each year: summary statistics and graphs  
 



## Dataset 5: [Medical Cost](https://github.com/cmich-stats-club/spring2024-dac/blob/main/datasets/medical-cost.csv)

  *	Check for outliers/irregular entries

Treat records and attributes that are flagged in the pre-processing steps.  

The following analysis may be of interest:
  *	Distribution of insurance subscribers’ age and bmi : summary statistics and graphs
  *	Distribution of medical cost billed by the insurance company: summary statistics and graph
  *	Testing hypothesis: For example, on average, medical cost is different for subscribers in South-East and South-West regions.
  *	ANOVA: Is there a difference in the average medical cost charged to insurance subscribers in the four regions?
